## What is the meaning for  "Mounted from bharatbhushan05/product-service"
The message "Mounted from bharatbhushan05/product-service" in the output means that certain layers of the Docker image you're trying to push (in this case, `bharatbhushan05/project-service`) are being reused from an existing image (`bharatbhushan05/product-service`). Docker uses a layer caching mechanism to avoid re-pushing layers that have already been pushed to the Docker registry.

Here's what happens in more detail:

1. **Docker Image Layers**: Docker images are made up of layers. Each instruction in a Dockerfile (such as `COPY`, `RUN`, `EXPOSE`) creates a new layer. When you build a new image, Docker checks if any layers from the base image or previous builds already exist in its local cache.
2. **Layer Caching**: If Docker detects that a layer in the new image is the same as one in an already pushed image, it will "mount" or reuse that layer, rather than pushing it again. This saves time and bandwidth.
3. **"Mounted from"**: This message indicates that Docker is using layers from the `bharatbhushan05/product-service` image rather than pushing those layers again.
In your case, it looks like some layers of your `project-service` image were already part of the `product-service` image, so Docker just reused them (mounted them), which is why you see the "Mounted from" message.
This behavior is common and efficient because Docker ensures that only new or changed layers get pushed to the Docker registry. If your `project-service` image shares some files or dependencies with the `product-service` image, those layers are reused.
