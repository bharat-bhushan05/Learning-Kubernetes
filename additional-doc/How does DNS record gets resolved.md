## How does DNS record gets resolved: e.g: How does the domain name https://kubernetes.io will get resolved in your browser?

DNS (Domain Name System) is the system that translates human-readable domain names (like `https://kubernetes.io`) into IP addresses, which computers use to identify each other on the network. When you type `https://kubernetes.io` in your browser, the browser must resolve the domain name into an IP address to establish a connection with the server hosting the website.

Here’s how DNS resolution works step-by-step for a domain like `https://kubernetes.io`:

### 1. **Browser Cache**
   - When you type a URL like `https://kubernetes.io`, the browser first checks its own **DNS cache** to see if it has previously resolved this domain. Browsers typically store DNS responses for a short period (defined by the TTL or Time-To-Live value of the DNS record).
   - If a cached record exists, the browser uses it and skips the rest of the steps.

### 2. **Operating System Cache**
   - If the browser doesn't have the record cached, it checks the **operating system's DNS cache**. The operating system also keeps a cache of recent DNS queries. If a matching entry is found, it's returned to the browser.
   
### 3. **Local DNS Resolver (ISP or Configured DNS Server)**
   - If the operating system cache doesn't contain the record, the request is forwarded to a **DNS resolver** (typically provided by your ISP or a custom DNS server like Google's `8.8.8.8` or Cloudflare's `1.1.1.1`).
   - The DNS resolver acts as an intermediary that either returns a cached record or queries other DNS servers on your behalf.

### 4. **Root DNS Server**
   - If the resolver doesn't have the domain in its cache, it starts the process of querying the DNS hierarchy, beginning with the **root DNS servers**. These servers don't know the IP address of specific domain names but can tell where to find the **TLD (Top-Level Domain)** servers, like `.io`.

### 5. **TLD DNS Server (Top-Level Domain)**
   - The resolver then queries the **TLD DNS server** for `.io`. This server doesn't know the exact IP address for `kubernetes.io` but knows which **Authoritative Name Server** is responsible for that domain.

### 6. **Authoritative Name Server for kubernetes.io**
   - The **TLD server** returns the IP address of the **Authoritative Name Server** for `kubernetes.io`. This is a DNS server that holds the actual DNS records for the domain. It knows the exact IP address of the `kubernetes.io` website.

### 7. **Fetching the DNS Records**
   - The resolver then queries the **Authoritative Name Server** for `kubernetes.io`, which returns the DNS records, including the **A record** (IPv4 address) or **AAAA record** (IPv6 address), which contains the IP address of the server hosting the website.

### 8. **DNS Resolver Caches the Response**
   - The **resolver** now caches the DNS record (to respond to future requests faster) and sends the IP address of `kubernetes.io` back to your operating system's DNS resolver.

### 9. **Operating System Passes the IP to Browser**
   - The operating system passes the IP address to the browser, which then initiates a **TCP connection** (often using **HTTPS** via **TLS**) to the server with that IP address.

### 10. **Browser Establishes a Connection**
   - The browser uses the IP address to connect to the server, sends an **HTTP/HTTPS request**, and retrieves the web page, displaying it in your browser.

### Example Scenario:
For `https://kubernetes.io`, this process might look like:

- The browser checks its cache for `kubernetes.io` → No cached entry.
- It queries the OS, which also doesn’t have the entry.
- The query is sent to the DNS resolver (e.g., Google's 8.8.8.8).
- The resolver queries a root server → Receives the `.io` TLD server address.
- The resolver queries the `.io` TLD server → Receives the authoritative DNS server for `kubernetes.io`.
- The authoritative DNS server returns the IP address for `kubernetes.io`.
- The resolver caches the result and sends it back to the browser.
- The browser connects to the IP address of `kubernetes.io`, and the website loads.

### DNS Record Types Involved:
Several types of DNS records might be queried in the process:
1. **A Record**: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
2. **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
3. **CNAME Record**: If the domain is an alias (not directly linked to an IP), a CNAME (Canonical Name) record might point to the actual domain.
4. **NS Record**: Points to the authoritative Name Servers responsible for the domain.
5. **SOA Record**: Contains information about the zone (domain) such as the primary name server.

This entire process typically happens in milliseconds, enabling browsers to quickly resolve domain names and load websites.
