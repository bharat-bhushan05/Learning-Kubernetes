Using custom metrics with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes allows you to scale your applications based on metrics other than the default CPU and memory. Custom metrics can be anything that you define, such as requests per second, queue length, or any application-specific metric.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up HPA using custom metrics:

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster (1.6 or later).
- Install the Metrics Server (if you haven’t already), but note that Metrics Server is primarily for standard metrics (CPU/memory).
- Install a custom metrics adapter that can expose custom metrics to HPA, such as:
  - **Prometheus Adapter**: If you're using Prometheus to scrape metrics.
  - **Kube Metrics Adapter**: For various sources of metrics.

### **2. Install Prometheus and Prometheus Adapter**
If you’re using Prometheus for monitoring, follow these steps:

1. **Install Prometheus**:
   You can use Helm to install Prometheus:
   ```bash
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo update
   helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
   ```

2. **Install the Prometheus Adapter**:
   Similarly, you can install the Prometheus Adapter using Helm:
   ```bash
   helm install prometheus-adapter prometheus-community/prometheus-adapter
   ```

### **3. Define Custom Metrics in Your Application**
You need to expose custom metrics from your application. Here’s an example of how to expose a custom metric:

1. **Modify Your Application**:
   If you have a web application, you can expose a custom metric (e.g., request count) using an HTTP endpoint. For example, if you're using a Python Flask application, you might use a library like `prometheus_flask_exporter` to expose metrics.

   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   from prometheus_flask_exporter import PrometheusMetrics

   app = Flask(__name__)
   metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)

   @app.route("/request")
   def handle_request():
       # Handle the request logic
       return "Request handled!"

   @app.route("/metrics")
   def metrics_route():
       # This route exposes metrics
       return metrics.export()
   ```

### **4. Create an HPA for Custom Metrics**
Now that your application exposes custom metrics, you can create an HPA using those metrics.

1. **Create an HPA YAML file** (e.g., `hpa-custom-metrics.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
   kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
   metadata:
     name: myapp-hpa
   spec:
     scaleTargetRef:
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       name: myapp-deployment
     minReplicas: 1
     maxReplicas: 10
     metrics:
       - type: Object
         object:
           metric:
             name: requests_total  # Name of the custom metric
           describedObject:
             apiVersion: apps/v1
             kind: Deployment
             name: myapp-deployment
           target:
             type: AverageValue
             averageValue: 100  # Scale up if average requests exceed 100
   ```

2. **Apply the HPA**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f hpa-custom-metrics.yaml
   ```

### **5. Verify HPA with Custom Metrics**
Check the status of your HPA to ensure it recognizes the custom metrics.

```bash
kubectl get hpa
```

### **6. Testing Custom Metrics HPA**
1. **Generate Load**: Simulate load on your application that generates custom metrics. You might use a tool like Apache Bench or a custom script.
2. **Observe Scaling**: While the load is running, check the HPA status again:
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa
   ```
   You should see the number of replicas changing based on the custom metric conditions defined in the HPA.

### **7. Cleanup**
Once you’re done testing, clean up the resources:
```bash
kubectl delete -f hpa-custom-metrics.yaml
```

### **Conclusion**
Using custom metrics with HPA allows for more intelligent scaling decisions based on the specific needs of your applications. Whether you choose to use Prometheus or another metrics source, integrating custom metrics provides significant flexibility for handling variable loads.
